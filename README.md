# Assignment-2---4110
Assignment 2 to my intro to Cloud computing course. This was an assignment that involved making an OpenStack instance
I used Microstack for this assignment since the Dev Ops environment for Openstack had endless errors it seemed. People were able to get it working after a ton of troubleshooting. But with the limited time I had, I found and used Microstack as a faster solution 

Assignemtn 2 guidelines:
Create a “hello world” website on TryStackinstance (http://trystack.org)
- Create network, instance, router and other necessary settings to host a web server
- choose either centos or ubuntuas your operating system
- Screenshot following pages of your dashboard
- Overview
- Instances
- Network Topology
- Networks
- Routers
- install a nodejsserver on the instance
- start the nodejsservice to host a “hello world” website
- the “hello world” website need to show your name and student ID
